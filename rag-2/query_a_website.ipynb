Embeddings \\n\\n    * Understanding embeddings allows models to understand relationships for tasks like text similarity, clustering, and classification. \\n    * Embedding models to generate vectors is helpful for tasks like search and recommendation.\\n    * Semantic text search using embeddings.\\n    * Evaluating embedding models (e.g., BERT vs. Word2Vec, etc.) to assess accuracy, speed, and their ability to capture contextual or domain-specific meanings.\\n\\n  * 2\\\\. Vector Databases \\n\\n    * Introduction to vector databases\\n    * Getting started with MongoDB Atlas\\n    * Loading data into databases and populating embeddings\\n    * Vector search with databases and embeddings\\n\\n  * 3\\\\. LLMs \\n\\n    * Introduction to LLMs\\n    * Access LLMs via APIs\\n      * Utilize APIs from platforms like OpenAI or Hugging Face to easily integrate and interact with pre-trained LLMs in your applications without complex setups.\\n    * Run LLMs locally using llama-cpp, oolama, lm-studio, jen, etc. \\n      * Learn how to deploy LLMs on your local machine using frameworks such as llama-cpp, oolama, lm-studio, and jen to reduce cloud reliance and increase control over your models.\\n    * Experiment with different LLMs\\n      * Explore and compare open-source LLMs to understand their performance, features, and suitability for specific tasks or environments.\\n\\n  * 4\\\\. Running LLMs \\n\\n    * Leverage specialized frameworks for seamless local LLM integration \\n      * By using tools like llama-cpp, llama-index, and Langchain, you can efficiently load, manage, and query Large Language Models (LLMs) on local machines.\\n    * Deploy LLMs on your local environment for faster, private AI processing\\n    * Test and compare different open-source LLMs to find the best fit for your project\\n      * Experimenting with models like Mistral, Llama, and others allows you to evaluate their performance in text generation, summarization, and question-answering tasks.\\n\\n  * 5\\\\. Develop a custom application using LLM \\n\\n    * Integrate LLM capabilities into your application by using pre-trained models like GPT to add features customized for your specific use case, such as natural language understanding, text generation, or summarization.\\n    * Leverage frameworks like Streamlit and Flask\\n      * Quickly build and deploy interactive web applications with minimal coding, allowing real-time interactions with your LLM-powered features. \\n    * Prototyping and scaling\\n      * Use these frameworks to create sample applications for testing and showcasing AI functionality, then scale them up for broader use in academic, research, or business environments, incorporating LLM-driven insights into everyday tasks.\\n\\n  * 6\\\\. Building RAG Applications \\n\\n    * Query PDF documents using LLMs\\n      * Utilize LLMs to process and query the content of PDF documents, extracting relevant information and insights through natural language queries.\\n    * Index documents with embeddings\\n      * Create embeddings for documents, turning their content into searchable vectors that capture the semantic meaning for efficient querying.\\n    * Use various embedding models (OpenAI, Mistral, open source models)\\n      * Leverage different embedding models from providers like OpenAI, Mistral, and other open-source options to convert documents into vector representations.\\n    * Query the documents using various LLMs (OpenAI, Mistral, LLama)\\n      * Employ LLMs such as OpenAI’s GPT, Mistral, or LLama to interpret and respond to user queries, retrieving relevant sections from indexed documents.\\n\\n  * 7\\\\. Deploying RAG Applications \\n\\n    * Set up and run Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications to combine real-time data retrieval with LLM-powered text generation for more accurate, context-aware outputs.\\n    * Use containerization tools like Docker to package your RAG application, ensuring consistency, portability, and ease of deployment across different environments.\\n    * Efficiently serve your LLMs or RAG models via APIs or frameworks, enabling real-time access and interactions with the models in your application.\\n    * Implement strategies like load balancing, distributed computing, and auto-scaling to ensure your application can handle increased demand while maintaining performance.\\n\\n  * 8\\\\. Workshop / Project \\n\\n    * Design an AI-powered tool tailored to your institution’s needs, such as an intelligent research assistant or personalized learning platform.\\n\\n  \\n\\n## If you have further questions, please contact us.\\n\\n[ Contact Us ](mailto:class@internet2.edu)\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n[ ![Internet2 logo](https://internet2.edu/wp-\\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/internet2-white.png) ](https://internet2.edu)\\n\\n### Follow Us:\\n\\n  * [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/Internet2social)\\n  * [Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/internet2social/)\\n  * [LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/internet2/?viewAsMember=true)\\n  * [YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6gxuEGpxW07lUFD0IEpRQA)\\n\\n  * [About Us](/community/about-us/)\\n    * [Membership](/community/about-us/membership/)\\n    * [News](/news)\\n    * [Executive Leadership](/community/about-us/executive-leadership)\\n    * [Media Resources](/community/about-us/media-resources/)\\n    * [Careers](/community/careers/)\\n    * [Policies](/community/about-us/policies/)\\n    * [Help](/contact-us/)\\n  * [Network](/network/)\\n    * [Networking for Cloud](/network/networking-cloud/)\\n    * [Operations and Support](/network/operations-and-support)\\n    * [State and Regional R&E; Networks](/network/state-and-regional-r-e-networks/)\\n  * [Security](/security/)\\n    * [Security Cloud Services](/security/security-cloud-services/)\\n    * [Performance & Analytics Tools](/security/performance-analytics/)\\n    * [Identity and Access Management](https://internet2.edu/security/identity-and-access-management/)\\n  * [Cloud](/cloud/)\\n    * [NET+ Cloud Services](/cloud/internet2-net-plus-services/)\\n    * [Cloud Connect](/services/cloud-connect/)\\n    * [Cloud Scorecard](/cloud/internet2-net-plus-services/cloud-scorecard/)\\n    * [Cloud Learning and Skills Sessions (CLASS)](/cloud/cloud-learning-and-skills-sessions/)\\n  * [Community](/community/)\\n    * [Research Engagement](/community/research-engagement/)\\n    * [Community Groups](/community/community-group-list/)\\n    * [Community Anchor Program](/community/community-anchor-program/)\\n\\n  * (C) 2024 Internet2\\n  * [Privacy Policy](/community/about-us/policies/privacy/)\\n  * [Terms of Use](/community/about-us/policies/terms-of-use/)\\n  * [Sitemap](https://internet2.edu/sitemap_index.xml)\\n  * [Site Design by FIREANT STUDIO](https://fireantstudio.com/)\\n\\n\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')\n"
